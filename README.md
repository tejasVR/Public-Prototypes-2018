# Public-Prototypes-2018
Hey there!

Back in the day when I was new to GitHub but was OCD about folder management, I uploaded a repo of my collection of projects done in early 2018. I created a massive repo, with various subfolders being my projects. I quickly learned that subfolder management got messy in GitHub, and so I then created separate repos for each individual project.

This repo is empty, but I'm just keeping it so most of the green on my commit graph doesn't totally disappear.

I've linked the GitHub links to my 2017 projects that were originally in this folder:

- Neon Bullet: https://github.com/tejasVR/Neon-Bullet
- Trajectory: https://github.com/tejasVR/Trajectory
